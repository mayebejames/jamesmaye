# Digoxin toxicity
Characterised by GI distress, hyperkalaemia and life threatening dysrhythmias.

Treated with monoclonal Ab [[Digibind]], definitive treatment if toxicity continued despite standard anti-arrhythmic management ([[Antiarrhythmic drugs]])

Digoxin is renally excreted so should be used with significant caution in renal impairment

[[Digoxin level]]  testing is taken 6+ hours post last dose when steady state expected to have been reached. Normal therapeutic range 0.6-1.3 nmol/L. Toxic levels can be >1.9nmol/L and >3.2 nmol/L, with worsening symptoms and higher level together increasing likelihood of toxicity
