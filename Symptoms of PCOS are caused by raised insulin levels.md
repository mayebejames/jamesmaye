# Symptoms of PCOS are caused by raised insulin levels

PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome)  is strongly associated with insulin resistance, particularly in overweight patients. This causes higher levels of circulating insulin, which acts on the ovaries to produce more testosterone, affecting menstruation, fertility and hirsutism. Metformin increases insulin sensitivity and is used to improve symptoms of PCOS including fertility and reduction in miscarriages up to 12 weeks, although it is relatively ineffective for hirsutism (spironolactone is more efficacious - why?)
