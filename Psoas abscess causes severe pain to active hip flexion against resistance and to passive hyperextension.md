# Psoas abscess causes severe pain to active hip flexion against resistance and to passive hyperextension
[[Psoas abscess]] is a condition characterised by nonspecific symptoms, but back and leg pain with severe pain on active hip flexion to resistance and to passive hip hyperextension (with the patient lying on their normal side and hip pulled gently backwards) should increase suspicion of an iliopsoas abscess.
