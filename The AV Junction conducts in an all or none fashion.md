# The AV Junction conducts in an all or none fashion


## Backlinks
* [[Atrial fibrillation]]
	* In atrial fibrillation the atrial muscle fibres depolarise and contract independently of one another. The loss of synchronous depolarisation means the loss of p waves, instead producing an irregular baseline from the random depolarisations of myocytes in the atrium. At times the baseline may look similar to [[atrial flutter]] waves for 2-3 seconds, especially in lead V1. The [[Atrioventricular junction]] is continuously bombarded with depolarisation waves of varying amplitude, making the depolarisation through the AV node and to the His bundle occur at irregular intervals. [[The AV Junction conducts in an all or none fashion]], so the depolarisation passing into the His bundle and beyond are of a constant intensity. This means the QRS complex morphology is normal in AF, despite the irregular activation of the AV node.
