* [[Troponin]]
	* [[Troponin]] T is a protein released from ischaemic heart myocytes. It is used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and to risk stratify patient with symptoms of signs of acute coronary syndrome. High-sensitivity assays such as those used at WSH are used as an early rule out for [[NSTEMI]] in patients presenting to ED with cardiac sounding chest pain and therefore suspected [[Acute coronary syndrome]] (ACS).
