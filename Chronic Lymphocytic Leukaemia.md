Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) is the commonest adult leukaemia in the Western world. Patients usually present in their 60s or 70s with an incidental finding of persistent leukocytosis on routine bloods and smear cells on subsequent blood film. There is a progressive accumulation of long-lived, non-functional B cells which infiltrate the blood, bone marrow,  lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and occasionally other organs. While CLL remains an incurable disease, many patients do not require treatment, going on to eventually pass away from other causes _with_ CLL rather than _due to_ CLL. Those that are symptomatic or have a poorer prognosis are often treated with either the combination chemotherapy FCR[^1] or the anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab to improve prognosis.

## Epidemiology
CLL is the commonest leukaemia in Western adults, accounting for 20-30% of all leukaemias in adults. It has an incidence of 2.5/100,000 per year in the West, 20--30 times greater than the incidence in Asian countries. CLL is predominantly a disease of the elderly, with a prevalence of >20/100,000 per year in the over 70s.  It has a male preponderance of approximately 2:1, with men having a worse prognosis.


## Aetiology
There are no known causes of CLL, with environmental factors such as radiation, chemical, or viral exposure having no impact on incidence. First and second degree relatives are at greater risk of CLL, implying some currently unknown genetic preponderance. This hypothesis is strengthened by studies showing that Japanese people are at a much lower risk of CLL even after emigration. Genetic changes within malignant lymphocytes highlight raised levels of the BCL-2 protein which blocks apoptosis, causing the lifespan of B-cell lymphocytes to increase and to slowly accumulate in the blood and bone marrow. 

## Clinical Features

* 70% of patients asymptomatic at presentation (but only ~15% have no findings of e.g. lymphadenopathy or organomegaly on examination)
* Lymphocytosis >5.0 × 10^9^/L -- usually >20, up to >400 × 10^9^/L
* With more advanced disease, can transform to a lymphoma-like picture:
	* Lymphadenopathy -- painless, symmetrical
	* Splenomegaly (66%)
	* Hepatomegaly
* Ultimately leading to bone marrow failure secondary to leukaemia infiltration:
	* Anaemia
	* Thrombocytopenia
	* Neutropenia
* Hypogammaglobulinaemia due to non-functional B cells predisposes to recurrent infections, particulalry _Herpes zoster_ (Shingles).
* B signs[^B] correlate with more advanced disease
* Autoimmune complications: 
	* Direct Coombs' positive (10--20%)
	* Warm Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia (in less than half of the Coombs' positive cases)
	* Autoimmune thrombocytopenia (1-2%)

## Prognosis & Natural History 
CLL remains an incurable disease with current therapy, although a few patients have been successfully cured with allogeneic stem cell transplants. Most patients with early stage, asymptomatic disease survive long enough to die of other causes. In symptomatic patients, infections are a major source of mortality and morbidity, with dysfunctional B-cells causing a hypogammaglobulinaemia and preponderance for infection. Advanced stage patients are at risk of bone marrow failure or transformation to Prolymphocytic Leukaemia, an aggressive variant of CLL with a prognosis of months.  Approximately 20% of CLL patients will develop a secondary malignancy; skin or colon malignancies are common.

## Investigations

* FBC showing a leucocytosis of >5 × 10^9^/L [^leuc]
* Blood film: mature lymphocytes and numerous **smear cells**, caused by damage to cells during slide preparation. A lack of smear cells should prompt consideration of a different diagnosis. 
* Haemolysis screen for warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
	* Direct Coombs' test 
	* Spherocytes, polychromasia, ↑ reticulocytes on blood film
* Peripheral immunophenotyping for diagnosis of specific form of leukaemia


## Differential Diagnosis
The key differentials for CLL are the various mature B-cell and T-cell lymphoproliferative diseases, such as Hairy Cell Leukaemia, Prolymphocytic Leukaemia, Follicular Lymphoma, T cell large granular lymphoma, B cell large granular lymphoma, etc. These are ultimately differentiated using morphology and immunophenotyping.

## Management
As CLL has a very indolent course, asymptomatic patients are usually monitored without treatment initially. The body of evidence suggests that outcome is improved by treatment only in patients who are Rai group III or above, so patients who are Rai 0--II are monitored until their disease becomes symptomatic or progressive. Once treatment is indicated, choice of management depends on performance status and the presence or absence of the P53 deletion in cancerous B cells. Patients with poor performance status may be treated with chlorambucil monotherapy, while patients with good performance status are treated with alemtuzumab if they are positive for the P53 deletion or if negative the combination therapy fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). 

Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the CD52 protein which is specific to the surface membrane of B cells, allowing the cancerous B cells to be targeted directly. Patients who receive either alemtuzumab or fludarabine require lifelong irradiated blood products, in order to prevent a transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. A past medical history of CLL should therefore require thorough review of drug history prior to giving blood products. Both these agents are associated with prolonged lymphopenia and subsequent risk of _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ infection, requiring cotrimoxazole prophylaxis or pentamidine nebulisers for three to six months following treatment.
