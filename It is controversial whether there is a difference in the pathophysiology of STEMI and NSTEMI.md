# It is controversial whether there is a difference in the pathophysiology of STEMI and NSTEMI
In the OPERA trial (Montalescot et al. 2007), STEMI and NSTEMI patients were found to have similar in-hospital and long-term prognoses and similar independent correlates with outcome, despite very different in-hospital management.  While the majority of STEMI patients receive  repercussion therapy (i.e. PPCI), this is rarely done for NSTEMI. One interpretation of this could be that NSTEMI patients recover well despite a lack of thrombectomy  (PPCI) or thrombolysis because in NSTEMI there is usually no non-patent artery occluded by thrombus.

At its core, the pathophysiology of [[myocardial infarction]] can be drilled down to a mismatch between oxygen demand and oxygen delivery, in a similar way to that of peripheral mechanisms of muscle fatigue anywhere in the body. This mismatch can be caused by coronary artery occlusion requiring PPCI ([[Type 1 MI]]), or [[Type 2 MI]] syndromes, such as a flow-limiting condition due to a stable plaque as in angina, vasospasm as in [[Prinzmetal angina]], coronary arteritis, or a systemic cause causing increased cardiac oxygen demand and/or  The theory then is that NSTEMI represents acute severe oxygen debt in the absence of new complete occlusion of a coronary artery due to thrombus. 

This would suggest that NSTEMIs would be much more likely in [[Type 2 MI]]s, where there is an ischaemic imbalance not caused by embolus but by any of the ab
