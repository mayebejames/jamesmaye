# Bullous Pemphigoid
Bullous pempigoid is an auto-immune condition where antibodies against hemidesmosome proteins are produced. This leads to sub-epidermal blistering of the skin which may be pruritic and usually heal without scarring. Classically bullous pemphigoid spares the mucosa, c.f. pemphigus. Diagnosis is by skin biopsy showing immunofluorescence of IgG and C3 at the dermis-epidermis junction. Oral corticosteroids are first line management.
