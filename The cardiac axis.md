# The cardiac axis

The cardiac axis is the average direction of ventricular depolarisation when looking at the heart from the front of the chest. It is important clinically because [[Cardiac axis deviation has various pathological causes]]. [[Determining the cardiac axis]] is done by assessing whether the QRS complexes in leads I, II, and III are net positive or negative, as [[The relative sizes of the R and S waves depends upon the direction of depolarisation]].

* [[Determining the cardiac axis]]
	* [[The cardiac axis]] is the mean vector of ventricular depolarisation within the QRS wave, looking at the heart face on from the front of the chest. Leads, I, II and to a lesser extent III are used to determine the cardiac axis. Determining this can be clinically useful as [[Cardiac axis deviation has various pathological causes]]
