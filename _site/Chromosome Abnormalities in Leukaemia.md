Cytogenetic (chromosomal) abnormalities are found in two-thirds of [[Acute Myeloid Leukaemia]] (AML) cases and three-quarters of [[Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia]] (ALL) cases.  Many of the chromosomal abnormalities in leukaemia and lymphoma are translocations, where genetic material is exchanged between two chromosomes. 

Chromosome abnormalities confer particular prognostic significance. For example, the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) confirms particulalry poor prognosis when seen in childhood ALL. The t(8;21) translocation generally implies good prognosis in adult AML meanwhile, generally meaning that bone marrow transplantation will not be required. 

Chromosome abnormalities can also be used as a marker of disease, and a sign of relapse. The abnormal DNA sequence signal can be amplified using PCR, making this a much more sensitive test in detecting residual leukaemia than through cytology.

Chromosome abnormality  Condition
----------------------  -------------------------------------
t(9;22)                 Philadelphia chromosome. Commonly 
                        seen in CML, confers poor prognosis 
                        in ALL.

t(15;17)                APML (AML M3) - treated with ATRA

t(8;21)                 AML with some differentiation (M2)
                        -- confers better prognosis

Hyperdiploidy           Childhood ALL: better prognosis 
(>47 chromosomes)                       

t(8;14)                Burkitt lymphoma

5q-                    Loss of long arm of Ch. 5.
                       Myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory 
                       anaemia) with abnormal megakaryocytes
                       responds to lenalidomide

t(14;18)              Follicular Non-Hodgkin lymphoma -- seen
                      in 75% of cases.
