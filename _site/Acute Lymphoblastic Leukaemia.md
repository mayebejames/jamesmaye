Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), is a high-grade [[Haematological Malignancy]].  It is the commonest form of cancer in children. Central nervous system involvement is common, requiring prophylactic intrathecal cytotoxic therapy. It is generally curable, with a cure rate of  greater than 80% with chemotherapy. ALL is further subclassified based upon immunohistochemistry.


## Epidemiology
It is the commonest form of cancer in children and while it can occur at any age it is predominantly diagnosed under the age of 20, with children under the age of 5 at particular risk.

## Clinical features
* Pancytopenia 
	* Due to bone marrow failure secondary to excessive blast cells
* Bruising
	* Due to thrombocytopenia
* Bone pain
* Lymphadenopathy
* B Symptoms of systemic disease (Ann Arbor B classification)
	* Fevers
	* Night sweats
	* Weight loss

## Prognostic factors
* Age: <1 year or >10 years worsens prognosis. Adults do particularly badly
* Highest pretreatment WCC - correlates with tumour load and prognosis
* Chromosome abnormalities
* Males generally worse prognosis than females
* T-cell disease generally worse than B-cell
* Response to treatment

Treatment response is measured by blast cell count in the marrow. A morphological remission is defined as blast cells making up <5% of the cells in the bone marrow. An alternative assessment is that of minimal residual disease, than uses PCR to amplify clonal rearrangements in tumour-specific genes (immunoglobulin genes in B-cell disease and T-cell receptor genes in T-cell disease).  This allows detection of 1 cell in 10,000. Children with persistence above one malignant cell in 10,000 one month into chemotherapy will require a more intensive regime. 

## Management
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is highly curable, with cure rates above 80%. Remission can generally be induced without myelosuppressive chemotherapy. As central nervous system involvement is common, prophylactic intrathecal cytotoxic therapy is used. 

Chemotherapy treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  can be divided into distinct phases. During induction, inpatient chemotherapy aims to remove the bulk of leukaemic cells (<5% blasts in marrow). This facilitates the return of normal bone marrow function. This is followed by consolidation therapy, designed to remove residual malingant cells. Following consolidation of remission, a maintenance regime of low dose oral chemotherapy is given for a further 1-3 years. This maintenance regime is specific to ALL. 

Stem cell transplantation is used in particularly poor prognosis malignancies. Prior to transplantation, a conditioning therapy of strong chemotherapy and total body radiotherapy kills all of the patient's bone marrow cells, resulting in complete bone marrow failure. The patient then receives a bone marrow transplant, recolonising the bone marrow with donor cells which then attack any residual malignant cells (graft-versus-leukaemia effect). Stem cell transplantation is a particularly risky treatment, and total body irradiation causes sterility. Because of this, stem cell transplantation is reserved for particulalry poor prognosis cases.
