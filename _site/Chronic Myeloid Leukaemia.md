Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder and [[Haematological Malignancy]] arising from the myeloid lineage of haematopoietic stem cells. It is characterised by a marked increase in granulocytes (WCC up to 300 x10^9^) and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. It is a disease of middle age, usually presenting during the indolent chronic phase of the disease with hypercatabolic symptoms of fatigue, weight loss and sweating. Splenomegaly, a markedly raised white cell count and anaemia are hallmarks of the disease. The Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) is seen in 95% of cases; the resultant BCR-ABL fusion protein is a potent tyrosine kinase, stimulating cell division. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is the mainstay of chemotherapy; with it, more than 70%  of patients survive more than 5 years from diagnosis. Stem cell transplantation remains the only curative option. 


## Epidemiology

CML is a rare disease, with a frequency of 1.25 per 100,000; it accounts for 15% of all adult leukaemias.  It is a disease of middle age; patients usually present around their 50s. CML is more common in females than males. Environmental risk factors include previous exposure to radiation. 


## Aetiology

For the vast majority of patients, the aetiology of CML is completely unknown. The only epidemiological risk factor identified is exposure to radiation.  The BCR-ABL fusion protein produced by the t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome translocation appears to be a universal causative agent: 95% of cases are found to have the Philadelphia chromosome, while the remaining 5% are thought to have other genetic abnormalities producing the BCR-ABL fusion gene without the classic 9;22 translocation.  The resultant BCR-ABL fusion protein is a potent tyrosine kinase. It has been shown both _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ to transform haematopoietic progenitor cells, blocking apopotosis, increasing proliferation and altering differentiation. 


## Clinical Features

* Splenomegaly seen in 75-90% of cases (40% >10cm)
	* may cause left hypochondrial pain, satiety, and sensation of abdominal fullness
* Catabolic symptoms: fatigue, weight loss, sweats
* Gout -- hyperuraemia secondary to increased cell turnover and purine catabolism
* Bruising/bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Priapism due to leucostasis from massive excess of neutrophils
* 30% asymptomatic at presentation; incidental finding on FBC
* Hepatomegaly rare (2%)


## Natural History

CML is considered to have three distinct phases: a baseline Chronic Phase; Accelerated Phase; and finally Blast Crisis. More than 85% of patients present in chronic phase, which is defined by its lack of features of accelerated phase of blast crisis. The duration of chronic phase before transformation is typically 3--6 years; it is least likely for the two years following diagnosis but thereafter has an annual incidence of 20-25%. Half of all CML cases go on to transform from chronic phase to blast crisis. 

The accelerated phase is generally brief, before transformation to blast crisis. It is characterised by increasing blood counts and organomegaly becoming increasingly resistant to therapy. Blasts constitute 10-19% of all white blood cells or bone marrow nucleated cells. Marked by the acquisition of new cytogenetic abnormalities in majority of patients.

Blast crisis resembles acute leukaemia: it is rapidly fatal, with more than 20% blasts or promyelocytes in the blood or bone marrow. Myeloid blast crises are associated with cells acquiring further copies of the Philadelphia chromosome.

## Differential Diagnosis

The majority of CML presents in the chronic phase, with a markedly raised neutrophil count but possibly few other features. Key differentials for chronic phase CML are therefore leucocytosis secondary to infection, inflammation, or malignancy:  inflammatory markers would be expected to be raised, in contrast to CML, and the Philadelphia chromosome absent. Chronic phase CML must also be differentiated from [[Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia]] (CMML),  which is characterised by  an absolute monocytosis, trilineage myelodysplasia, and an absence of the Philadelphia chromosome. 

5% of CML cases present with predominant thrombocytosis: [[Essential Thrombocytosis]] must be excluded, usually by absent Philadelphia chromosome in affected cells. 


## Investigations
When suspecting a diagnosis of CML, the following should be considered:

* FBC and blood film show marked ↑WCC (>25 x10^9^/L, often up to 2-300 x10^9^/L)
	* Predominantly neutrophils with significant left shift
	* basophilia, sometimes eosinophilia
* Markers for infection: ESR, CRP, [Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase(NAP)]
	* Likely to be low/normal in absence of infection, used to differentiate from leucocytosis secondary to infection
* Anaemia common
* Platelets can be increased, decreased, or normal
* LDH and urate levels ↑ due to increased cellular destruction (↑turnover)
* Bone marrow shows marked hypercellularity due to myeloid hyperplasia
	* chronic phase: blasts <10%
	* accelerated phase: blasts 10-19%
	* blast crisis: blasts >20%
* Trephine biopsy -- useful to assess for marrow fibrosis
* Cytogenetic analysis of blood or marrow to assess for Philadelphia chromosome 
	* FISH analysis can confirm Philadelphia chromosome
	* rt-PCR can quantify BCR-ABL quantities for use in subsequent monitoring to assess response to therapy


## Prognosis
The median survival from diagnosis is greater than 5 years; greater than 70% of adults survive beyond 5 years. Increasing age at time of diagnosis is a sign of poor prognosis, with 90% of those diagnosed below the age of 65 surviing to 5 years but  only 40% of those over 65 surviving to 5 years. 

The [Sokal score](https://www.mdcalc.com/sokal-index-chronic-myelogenous-leukemia-cml) is used to categorise patients into poor, moderate and good prognosis groups based upon patients treated with chemotherapy. It uses an exponential function on values at diagnosis for age, spleen size, platelet count, and % blasts in blood. It can be used to predict the response to imatinib 400mg OD of a newly diagnosed patient in chronic phase. 


## Management 
Due to the chronic nature of CML, chemotherapy alone is not curative. The aims of chemotherapy are therefore to induce remission. Remission is defined in a number of ways:

* Clinical remission -- reduction of hypercatabolic symptoms and splenomegaly
* Haematological remission -- FBC values returning to normal range
* Cytogenetic remission --  disappearance of Philadelphia chromosome from marrow cells
* Molecular remission -- non-detection of BCR-ABL by rtPCR (3 log ↓)

Imatinib is the first line treatment for newly diagnosed patients in the chronic phase. It is continued to failure, sub-optimal response to failure. Imatinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor which is partially-specific to the BCR-ABL fusion protein.  The IRIS trial[^1]  showed an 87% complete cytogenetic remission and 89% survival at 5 years. Common side effects of imatinib include myelosuppression,  oedema, nausea, rashes, cramps, fatigue, diarrhoea, headache, arthralgia, and abnormal LFTs.  Neutropenia secondary to myelosuppression is managed with G-CSF such as filgastrim or by reducing or suspending treatment. Platelet counts below 50 are managed with suspended or reduced treatment. 

Allopurinol is used to reduce the risk of gout. Patients in CML are predisposed to gout due to the high cellular turnover, producing an excess of purines which are then catabolised to urate. 

Hydroxyurea (aka hydroxycarbamide) may be used to treat severe leucocytosis. 

Allogeneic bone marrow transplant remains the only curative option, with complete bone marrow destruction and the graft-versus-leukaemia effect enabling removal of all malignant cells. It carries a high mortality however, so is used in poor prognosis patients with low transplant risk.
