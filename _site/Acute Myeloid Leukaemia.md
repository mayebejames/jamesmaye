Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a high-grade [[Haematological Malignancy]] arising from myeloid stem cells or myeloblast cells, the precursors of monocytes and granulocytes[^1].  AML predominantly affects adults, with incidence increasing with age. It is the commonest acute leukaemia in adults and has the shortest median survival[^3]. It is defined as >20% bone marrow mononuclear cells[^2] on biopsy. CNS involvement is rare.


## Epidemiology
Characteristically a disease of adults, AML can occur at any age but incidence increases with age. It is the most common and most severe of all acute leukaemias in adults. Incidence is 400 times higher in Down syndrome. 

## Aetiology
The vast majority of AML cases are idiopathic. Some are secondary to progression from myelodysplasia, very rarely from myeloproliferative disorders. Therapy-related AML is a long-term complication of past chemotherapy with topoisomerase II inhibitors such as etoposide. Therapy-related AML carries a very poor prognosis. 

## Clinical features
Due to an excess of blasts in the bone marrow, AML presents with acute bone marrow failure and pancytopenia. Anaemia will present with paleness and tiredness. Thrombocytopenia with bleeding, bruising, and purpura. Neutropenia with neutropenic sepsis or recurrent infections. 

In addition, the huge cell turnover rate produces a global state of catabolism, producing the classic  symptoms of weight loss, fevers and sweats. 

Organ tissue may become infiltrated with blasts, causing hepatosplenomegaly and gingival hypertrophy. CNS involvement is usually rare in primary disease, however recurrent disease may spread to the CNS. 

## Investigations
* Blood film -- pancytopenia
* Bone marrow aspiration and trephine
	* accumulation of blasts: AML is by definition mononuclear cells account for >20% of bone marrow.
	* C.f. normal: <5%
* Immunophenotyping
	* FACS flow cytometry to confirm myeloid lineage and definition of AML specifically
* Karyotyping
	* t(8;21) has more favourable prognosis. t(15;17) associated with [[/Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML)]] and so management with ATRA. 

## Morphology and subtyping
Myeloid blast cells are differentiated from lymphoid blast cells with the presence of **Auer rods**, stick-like crystallisations of myeloid granules within the cytoplasm. 

The French-American-ritish morphological classification system of acute leukaemia utilises the fact that some of the proliferating blast cells begin to differentiate along a specific myeloid pathway, depending on the particular genetic abnormalities causing the leukaemia. In AML there are eight morphological subcategories in this system, M0--M7. There are two subtypes of note, with the rest largely treated similarly.

### Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML)
Classified as AML M3, promyelocytic leukaemia is classically caused by the t(15;17) translocation through the retinoic acid receptor and PML. PML is a nuclear regulatory factor required for cellular apoptosis. The fusion protein created causes a maturation block, leading to chronic lack of blast differentiation and acute myeloblastic anaemia. 

On histology APML blasts are strongly sudan-black/peroxidise positive. Variant M3 is hypogranular but otherwise identical.

APML carries a high risk of DIC due to the release of procoagulant promyelocyte granules, either spontaneously or from dying blast cells in the early phases of chemotherapy. Support with platelet transfusion and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is often required. 

Because of the retinoic acid-PML t(15;17) fusion protein, APML is uniquely managed with **All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)**, also known as tretinoin (different to isotretinoin). ATRA allows abnormal promyelocytes to differentiate by overcoming the maturation block caused by the fusion protein. It also limits the threat of DIC. ATRA has significantly improved the prognosis of APML, which was previously one of the more severe subtypes of AML. 

### Acute monocytic leukaemia
Acute monocytic leukaemia, AML M5, is characterised by morphological features of monocytic differentiation. It is strongly positive for non-specific esterase. Clinically there is often significant tissue infilatration of gums, liver/speen, lymph nodes and skin. As it is a proliferation of monocyte lineage, the release of the microbicidal enzyme lysozyme from malignant cells can damage the renal tubules, causing a potassium leak and so hypokalaemia.

## Prognostic factors
* Particular [[Chromosome Abnormalities in Leukaemia]] 
	*  t(8;21) is particularly good and generally does not require bone marrow transplantation
* \>60y poorer prognosis
* Response to first-round induction chemotherapy

## Management 
As with [[Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia]],  management is characterised by induction combination chaemotherapy as an inpatient to remove the bulk of leukaemic cells and return normal bone marrow function. Consolidation therapy to remove any residual leukaemia cells is subsequently used. Unlike ALL, low-dose oral maintenance chemotherapy is not usually used subsequently. 

Bone marrow transplant may also be used. This consists of myeloablation, where cytotoxic radio and chemotherapy induces complete destruction of the bone marrow, and subsequent replacement of the bone marrow with transplant tissue. This produces a beneficial graft-vs-leukaemia effect, destroying additional leukaemia cells. This explains why non-twin tissue transplantation has a lower relapse rate.

As CD33 is a transmembrane receptor generally specific to the myeloid lineage, anti-CD33 monoclonal antibodies have been trialled in AML. Their effect has so far been relatively underwhelming[^4], although future monoclonal antibodies may improve this.
