Beta blockers are a class of [[Antiarrhythmic drugs]].

* [[Tachy-brady syndrome]]
	* In Tachy-brady syndrome, patients suffer from alternations of [[Tachycardia]] and [[Bradycardia]]. This can prove difficult to treat medically, as treating one of these (e.g. the tachycardias) increases the risk of the other concomitantly. Pacing for the bradycardic episodes in conjunction with rate-slowing medications (?[[Beta blockers]]?) may be required if a patient is symptomatic or unstable.
