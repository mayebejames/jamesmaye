# Warfarin has an effective half life of 48-72 hours

As [[Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist]], [[Warfarin]] acts to inhibit [[Coagulation]] indirectly. [[Vitamin K]] acts an an enzyme integral to the production of various clotting factors, notably Factors VII, IX & X (see [[The clotting cascade]]). The effective half life of warfarin is therefore a product of the biological half life of warfarin in the body, the rate of active vitamin K repletion and then the rate of clotting factor production following raised vitamin K levels.

The biological half life of warfarin is in the region of 40 hours but is very variable. It is is metabolised by the highly polymorphic [[Cytochrome P450]] cytochrome CYP2C9, which is impacted both by genetic polymorphism and by the fact that [[Cytochrome P450 function is sensitive to many factors]].
