# Spirochaetes
Spirochaetes are a phylum of bacteria with a distinct double-layered cell membrane and coiled/spiralled morphology. Examples of pathogens from the spirochaete phylum are *Leptopira spp.* ([[Leptospirosis]], *Borelia* ([[Lyme Disease]]), *Treponema palladium* ([[Syphilis]], [[Yaws]]).

* [[Leptospirosis]]
	* [[Spirochaetes]] spread to multiple organs via the blood as leptospira levels increase following exposure. The clinical manifestations of leptospirosis infection reflect the organ dysfunction caused by either direct action of the leptospires or the host immune response to the infection.  This pathological immune response is responsible for the second phase of leptospirosis pathology. While subclinical disease is seen in endemic areas, the majority of cases in the UK will be diagnosed following moderate to severe disease which may be either self-limiting or progress to organ failure ([[/Weil's disease]])
