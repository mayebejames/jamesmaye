# Heart Failure

Heart failure affects 1-2% of the UK population, 10-20% of the over 75s and accounts for 5% of all emergency admissions.  Patients presenting with severe heart failure (breathlessness at rest) have one year motality rates of up to 52%. (SCRIPT Heart Failure ecourse, 2021)

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, previously called left ventricular dysfunction) is most commonly associated with hypertension and ischaemic heart disease. It can also be found associated with valvular disease and in younger patients with myocardial disease causing dilated cardiomyopathy.
