Pulmonary nodules are focal opacities measuring up to 3cm in diameter completely surrounded by lung parenchyma (including abutting pleura). They are common incidental findings on chest CT, being reported in 20-50% of patients in screening trials (Callister, 2015). While the majority are benign, approximately 1-5% represent early malignant lung cancers.

Pulmonary nodules are classified as solid or sub-solid, with the latter further differentiated into pure ground-glass (pGGN) and part-solid (PSN), based upon CT morphology. Part-solid nodules more often represent malignancy. 

The majority of pulmonary nodules found incidentally are monitored with repeat scanning and volumetric analysis in months-years, using the risk-stratification algorithms from the BTS guidelines (see [[/Management]] below). Those at highest risk of malignancy using the [[Brock Model estimates the cancer risk of a pulmonary nodule]] may undergo PET-CT and further biopsy or excision. 


## Pulmonary Nodules on CT

Nodules appear as contrast-enhancing lesions of up to 3cm diameter surrounded fully by lung parenchyma or pleura. They may be a purely Solid Nodule (A below), a Part-solid Nodule (B) or pure ground glass nodule (C). Part-solid nodules are at highest risk of malignancy. Further morphology can aid risk-stratification, with spiculating lesions or those tethering fissures, pleura, or vessels at higher risk of malignancy ([[Brock Model estimates the cancer risk of a pulmonary nodule/Risk Factors]]).

## Causes of Pulmonary Nodules

_From Au-Yong, 2020_ 

### Malignant causes

* [[Bronchogenic carcinoma]]
* [[Metastasis]]
* [[Carcinoid Tumour]]

### Benign Causes

* [[Hamartoma]]
* Infection, including fungal and mycobacterial infections
* [[Granuloma]]
* [[Rheumatoid Nodule]]
* [[Arteriovenous malformation]] (AV malformation)
* Intrapulmonary lymph nodes
* [[Amyloidosis]]


## Management

The initial management of incidental finding of pulmonary nodule is determined using the BTS risk algorithms (*Callister et al.*, 2015).
Patients should be referred to the Pulmonary Nodules MDT for assessment and determination of followup/further investigation.

_Note: The Fleischner Society has slightly varying guidelines for strictly incidental findings of Pulmonary Nodules on CT._
