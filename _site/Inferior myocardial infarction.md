# Inferior myocardial infarction

A myocardial infarction wit 

Vast majority (80%) of inferior STEMIs are due to occlusion of the dominant [[Right coronary artery]] (RCA)

Less commonly (18%), the culprit vessel is a dominant [[Left circumflex artery]] (LCx)

Very occasionally, an inferior STEMI may occur due to occlusion of a wraparound (type III) [[Left anterior descending artery]] (LAD). This produces concomitant inferior and anterolateral STEMI ([[Anterolateral myocardial infarction]].

* [[Cardiac axis deviation has various pathological causes]]
	* LAD is most commonly caused by left ventricular hypertrophy or a conduction defect, either of the His bundle itself ([[Left bundle branch block]]) or loss of cardiomyocytes to depolarise in the right atrium and ventricle due to [[Inferior myocardial infarction]].
* [[Determining RCA vs LCx occlusion in inferior STEMI]]
	* An [[Inferior myocardial infarction]] most commonly occurs due to the occlusion of a dominant [[Right coronary artery]] (80%). In a significant minority (18%) of cases, the occlusion is in a dominant [[Left circumflex artery]].
