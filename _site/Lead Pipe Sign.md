The lead pipe sign is a radiological sign seen on abdominal XRay (classically with barium enema but also without),  CT and MRI. It is suggestive of ulcerative colitis.

The lead pipe sign describes loss of haustral markings in the colon, creating a featureless 'pipe' of bowel. This is the result of contracted hypertrophic muscularic mucosae, secondary to increased mucosal regeneration in ulcerative colitis. Note that the normal haustral pattern is to have more haustra in the right colon, with decreasing levels distally. There may be few haustral folds in the descending colon, making it important to not overdiagnose led pipe sign.

> **Report:** Gas-filled rectum, sigmoid, descending and transverse colon with mural thickening and lead pipe appearance represents colitis and is in keeping with history of inflammatory bowel disease. No significantly dilated loops of bowel to indicate toxic megacolon.  No signs of pneumoperitoneum or obstruction. No radiopaque gallbladder calculi. Unremarkable appearance of the sacroiliac joints.

> **Report:** Double contrast barium enema demonstrates a featureless descending and sigmoid colon, lacking normal haustral marking. There are no stenoses or masses. No evidence of fistula formation. 
> The ascending and transverse colon appear normal with preserved normal haustral folds. The terminal ileum is distended and normal in appearance.
