# The relative sizes of the R and S waves depends upon the direction of depolarisation

In an ECG depolarisation towards a lead is denoted with upwards deflection, while depolarisation moving away from the lead is shown as a downwards deflection. This means that if [[The QRS complex]] is predominantly positive (R greater than S) depolarisation is occurring towards that lead. If it is predominantly negative (R smaller than S) depolarisation is occurring away from the lead. If the depolarisation occurs orthogonal to a lead, the lead will be isoelectric, having either equally sized R and S waves or a flat-line QRS with no discernible features.

The above principles can be used to determine [[The cardiac axis]]. [[Can R-S wave size inform the locations of ectopic beats?]]

* [[The cardiac axis]]
	* The cardiac axis is the average direction of ventricular depolarisation when looking at the heart from the front of the chest. It is important clinically because [[Cardiac axis deviation has various pathological causes]]. [[Determining the cardiac axis]] is done by assessing whether the QRS complexes in leads I, II, and III are net positive or negative, as [[The relative sizes of the R and S waves depends upon the direction of depolarisation]].
* [[Determining the cardiac axis]]
	* Each lead of the 12-lead ECG is recording the potential difference in a particular vector direction as it changes over time. Depolarisations towards the vector are positive (upwards), those away negative (downwards) and those orthogonal to the vector cause no deflection. The vectors for the limb leads are given above: lead I is at 0°, directly to the left. Lead II is at 60°, inferiorly and to the left, while lead III is at 120°, inferiorly and to the right. Thus, the QRS complex in lead I will be mostly positive (R>S, see [[The relative sizes of the R and S waves depends upon the direction of depolarisation]]) with a mean depolarisation vector between -90° and 90°, lead II between -30° and 150°, and lead III between 30° and 210°.
* [[The QRS Complex]]
	* The QRS complex describes the wave of depolarisation spreading through the ventricles. [[The relative sizes of the R and S waves depends upon the direction of depolarisation]]
