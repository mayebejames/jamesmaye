# Antibiotics in liver failure

* Ascertain the safety of any antibacterial in liver disease before prescribing.
* For complex cases, seek specialist advice from the regional Liver Unit.
* Perform more frequent monitoring of LFTs when known or potentially hepatotoxic antibacterials are prescribed.
* Avoid drugs such as azithromycin, co-trimoxazole, fusidic acid, and moxifloxacin; there are usually safer alternatives.
* Some drugs known to be hepatoxic can still be used in severe liver disease if essential (e.g. rifampicin, flucloxacillin and co-amoxiclav), but alterations in dosage are required. Use safer alternatives if possible.
