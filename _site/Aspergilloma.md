An aspegilloma is a ball of fungus that develops within a pre-existing lung cavity. Symptoms of an aspergilloma include cough, haemoptysis and shortness of breath. Once the disease becomes invasive and therefore systemic it can produce fevers, chills, and chest and joint pain. Itraconazole is first line antifungal management in aspergilloma, with surgical removal a possibility.

Causes of the pre-existing lung cavity include tuberculosis, lung cancer or cystic fibrosis.

Findings on chest X ray include cavitating lesions with a rounded opacity within the cavity.  On CT a air crescent sign may be seen in invasive aspergillosis, usually heralding recovery as it is the result of increased neutrophil absorption of necrotic lung tissue. Other investigations include tests for Aspergillus preciptins, which will have high titres in aspergilloma.
