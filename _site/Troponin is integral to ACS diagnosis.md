# Troponin is integral to ACS diagnosis

[[Troponin]] T is a protein released from ischaemic heart myocytes. It is used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and to risk stratify patient with symptoms of signs of acute coronary syndrome. High-sensitivity assays such as those used at WSH are used as an early rule out for [[NSTEMI]] in patients presenting to ED with cardiac sounding chest pain and therefore suspected [[Acute coronary syndrome]] (ACS). 

If a patient has presented less than 3 hours from the onset of cardiac sounding chest pain (with no high risk features), a baseline Trop T should be taken followed by a second Trop T at 3 hours from onset of pain. If the patient has presented more than 3 hours form the onset of the chest pain a baseline admission Trop T should be taken and a second sample taken 1 hour later. The absolute troponin level and the change between first and second troponin level should be interpreted alongside clinical history, examination and ECG.

Interpreting the rise in the Trop T levels between baseline and second level:

-   Rise of more > 5 ng/L rules in ACS and treatment should be started immediately

-   A rise of 3-4.9 ng/L should be risk stratified using the GRACE2 score with further
    treatment as indicated
    
-   A rise of Trop T < 3ng/L rules out ACS. All patients with ACS ruled out should be 
    considered for referral to the Rapid Access Chest Clinic
    
    
There are other causes of an elevated Troponin T, meaning that the dynamic rise in Troponin described above with concomitant cardiac sounding chest pain  is more sensitive than the absolute level of troponin. Other causes of a raised troponin include:

-   [[Aortic dissection]]

-   [[Acute Kidney Injury]] or [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]

-   [[Tachycardia]] or [[Bradycardia]]

-   Infiltrative diseases

-   [[Burns]]

-   [[Cardiac contusions]] following blunt force trauma

-   [[Hypothyroidism]]

-   [[Rhabdomyolysis]]
