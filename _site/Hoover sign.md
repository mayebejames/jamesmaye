Hoover’s sign describes the presence or loss of the normal reflex of contralateral hip 	extension on active ipsilateral hip flexion.
Loss of this contralateral extension suggests weakness or paresis of hip extension. Presence of this contralateral extension in a patient presenting with lower limb weakness or paralysis suggests that the weakness may be functional, in one of two ways. 

Firstly, for a patient with weakness of hip flexion , ask the patient to flex their weak leg at the hip while you feel below the contralateral heel. If you feel no extension this is suggestive of a functional weakness, i.e. that no effort is transmitted to either leg. Secondly for a patient with weakness of hip extension on voluntary testing, ask the patient to flex their good leg against resistance while keeping hand under the heel of the weak leg. If you feel downward pressure this is suggestive that the weakness is functional.


## Physiological basis

The physiological basis of this is Sherrington’s Crossed extension reflex. The archetypal example of this is standing on a pin: reflexively the ipailateral hip flexes to remove the foot from the pain, while the contralateral hip extends to stabilise the trunk.  Sherrington demonstrated this in decortical and decerebral animals, as it involves excitatory spinal imterneurons which traverse multiple spinal levels before producing an antagonistic contraction in the opposite limb.
