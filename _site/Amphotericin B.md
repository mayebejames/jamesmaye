Amphotericin comes in three forms which have **different doses and are not interchangeable**:
* Conventional amphotericin
* Lipid-complex amphotericin
* Liposomal amphotericin

In the UK, three fatal overdoses have been reported caused by the administration of the conventional amphotericin B formulation when the dose had been calculated and prescribed based on the liposomal or lipid-complex formulation (which has a much higher dose regimen).
