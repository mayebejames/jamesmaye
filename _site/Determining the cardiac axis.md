# Determining the cardiac axis

[[The cardiac axis]] is the mean vector of ventricular depolarisation within the QRS wave, looking at the heart face on from the front of the chest. Leads, I, II and to a lesser extent III are used to determine the cardiac axis. Determining this can be clinically useful as [[Cardiac axis deviation has various pathological causes]]

Vector diagram of the limb leads showing the cardiac axis

Each lead of the 12-lead ECG is recording the potential difference in a particular vector direction as it changes over time. Depolarisations towards the vector are positive (upwards), those away negative (downwards) and those orthogonal to the vector cause no deflection. The vectors for the limb leads are given above: lead I is at 0°, directly to the left. Lead II is at 60°, inferiorly and to the left, while lead III is at 120°, inferiorly and to the right. Thus, the QRS complex in lead I will be mostly positive (R>S, see [[The relative sizes of the R and S waves depends upon the direction of depolarisation]]) with a mean depolarisation vector between -90° and 90°, lead II between -30° and 150°, and lead III between 30° and 210°.

The normal cardiac axis is between -30° and 90°, meaning that leads I and II are always positive in normal cardiac axis, while lead III can be positive or negative. In left axis deviation (i.e. cardiac axis vector beyond -30°) lead I will be positive while II and III negative. Conversely, in right axis deviation (beyond 90°), lead I will be negative while II and III will be positive. 

Extreme axis deviation, when leads I, II, and aVF are negative while aVR ± III and aVL are positive, is a rare finding which in an otherwise clinically well patient is most likely explained by reversal of the right arm and left leg ECG leads.

* [[The cardiac axis]]
	* The cardiac axis is the average direction of ventricular depolarisation when looking at the heart from the front of the chest. It is important clinically because [[Cardiac axis deviation has various pathological causes]]. [[Determining the cardiac axis]] is done by assessing whether the QRS complexes in leads I, II, and III are net positive or negative, as [[The relative sizes of the R and S waves depends upon the direction of depolarisation]].
