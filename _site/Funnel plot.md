# Funnel plot
A funnel pilot is used in meta-analysis to demonstrate publication bias in meta analyses. They are plotted with treatment effect on the x axis and study size on the y.
A symmetrical inverted funnel shape implies that bias is unlikely, whereas an asymmetrical shape implies that study size has an effect of treatment effect size.
