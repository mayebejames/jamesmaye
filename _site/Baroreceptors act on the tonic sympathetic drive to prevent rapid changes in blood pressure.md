# Baroreceptors act on the tonic sympathetic drive to prevent rapid changes in blood pressure
Regulation of blood pressure within a physiological range is achieved by a number of different systems. The baroreceptor reflex is responsible for preventing or reducing large changes in blood pressure due to external changes, such as the large diversion of blood to the lower extremities by gravity when moving from lying to standing.

Baroreceptors are predominantly found at the bifurcation of the carotids in the left and right carotid sinuses. Additional baroreceptors are found in the arch of the aorta, although this area is predominately populated by chemoreceptors. 

As arterial pressure rises, stretch in the wall of the carotid artery and aortic arch stimulates the baroreceptors. This increases the nerve impulses to the vasomotor centre via the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX) for the carotid sinus baroreceptors and the [[vagus nerve]] (CN X) for those in the aortic arch. These inhibitory impulses dampen the sympathetic output of the vasomotor centre to the heart and the blood vessels. Reduction in sympathetic drive to these areas causes a reduction in cardiac output by reducing heart rate and contractility and peripheral vasodilation. These effects combine to rapidly reduce the arterial pressure towards baseline.

Conversely, a drop in blood pressure reduces stretch forces on the baroreceptors, reducing the extent of inhibitory impulses. This increases sympathetic drive and therefore increases peripheral blood pressures towards normal.

This negative feedback system utilises a background level of sympathetic activity which can then be rapidly increased or decreased, creating a rapidly adjustable control on blood pressure. This means that external changes that cause hypotension are often first detected not as hypotension but as signs of the baroreceptor reflex, with blood pressure maintained within normal range by tachycardia, for example.
