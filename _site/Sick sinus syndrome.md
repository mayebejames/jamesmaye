# Sick sinus syndrome

Sick sinus syndrome is usually caused by sinus node fibrosis, typically in elderly patients.
Symptoms include syncope and pre-syncope, light-headedness, palpitations and breathlessness. It is managed with permanent pacemakers for patients who had symptomatic bradycardia or sinus pauses. If AF is detected then thromboembolic prophylaxis is given. Some patients develop [[Tachy-brady syndrome]], with alternating tachycardic and bradycardic rhythms.
