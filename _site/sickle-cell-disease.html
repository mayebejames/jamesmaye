<h2 id="pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</h2>
<p>Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive genetic condition caused by a single amino acid substitution in the β-globin subunit of haemoglobin (HbS). This causes polymerisation of HbS and precipitation out of the intracellular fluid in deoxygenated environments, causing the red blood cell membrane to deform, forming the sickle morphology characteristic of the disease. This change in morphology causes greater adhesion to the endothelial wall of the vessel lumen, mediated primarily by integrins on the cell membrane and adhesion molecules on the endothelial surface. This causes occlusion of the vessel lumen by sickled red cells, causing the vaso-occlusive crises characteristic of the disease. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF greatly stimulate this process; infections can therefore provoke a sickle crisis.</p>
<p>Foetal haemoglobin, HbF, has been shown to reduce the rate of polymer formation within red blood cells. This may be the mechanism by which certain ethnic populations generally have milder sickle cell disease, with greater levels of HbF persisting into adulthood. Hydroxyurea stimulates HbF production and is now widely used in prevention of sickle crises.</p>
<h2 id="clinical-features">Clinical features</h2>
<p>Sickle cell disease is characterised by increased erytrhocyte turnover causing a chronic anaemia and acute crises due to erythrocyte sickling and occlusion of the vasculature. The clinical manifestation of sickle cell disease varies wildly from asymptomatic anaemia to frequent acute crises. The pathophysiology of this variation is not understood, although it is thought that some of the variation is accounted for by varying levels of foetal haemoglobin HbF (<a href="#pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</a>).</p>
<p>The vast majority of sickle cell patient suffer from a steady state anaemia of Hb 60-90 g/L due to reduced erythrocyte lifespan. This is associated with hyperbilirubinaemia and raised reticulocyte count due to excess red cell turnover. Chronic end-organ damage due to vaso-occlusive events can cause any of a wide range of chronic disease. These include avascular necrosis of the femoral heads; <a href="#splenic-infarction-and-asplenia">Splenic infarction and Asplenia</a> with consequent immune compromise; pulmonary hypertension; chronic kidney disease; proliferative retinopathy; ceverbrovascular disease; pigment gallstones due to hyperbilirubinaemia; and leg ulcers.</p>
<h3 id="vaso-occlusive-pain-crises">Vaso-occlusive pain crises</h3>
<p>Vaso-occlusive crises are the most common cause for hospitalisation in sickle cell disease. They are diagnosed clinically, being characterised by deep bone pain due to vaso-occlusive infarction of the red bone marrow. This often requires opitate analgesia, usually diamorphine. Patient controlled analgesia, NSAIDs, and nitric oxide for vasodilation are also used. Vigorous hydration may shorten crisis duration, while oxygen therapy should be given if oxygen saturations are low. A thorough assessment for infection and blood cultures should be taken, with antibiotic treatment if indicated.</p>
<h3 id="acute-chest-syndrome">Acute Chest syndrome</h3>
<p>This is a serious complication and the second most common cause for admission in sickle cell disease, often requiring exchange transfuion. Acute chest syndrome describes an acute lung injury due to vaso-occlusive pulmonary infarction ± infection. Common presenting features include chest pain, fever, tachypnoea, wheeze, cough, hypoxia and new pulomonary infiltrate on CXR consistent with alveolar consolidation in at least one complete lung segment.</p>
<h3 id="splenic-infarction-and-asplenia">Splenic infarction and Asplenia</h3>
<p>The spleen acts to remove senescent red cells from the circulation at the end of their lifespan. As older red cells are more predisposed to irreversible sickling, the spleen is a common location for vaso-occlusion and infarction. Acutely, episodes of splenic infarction present with pleuritic left hypochondrium pain often radiating to the left shoulder. On auscultation a rub over the affected location may be heard.</p>
<p>Functional asplenia due to multiple episodes of splenic infarction occurs at an early age in sickle cell patients, predisposing to infection. As with any asplenia, strategies for reducing this risk include penicillin prophylaxis for children under 5 years, up to date immunizations (especially to capsulated bacteria such as pneumococcus and meningococcus) and patient education regarding seeking medical care for every fever.</p>
<p>Prior to complete infarction of the spleen, children may suffer from an acute splenic sequestration crisis, where the spleen and liver rapidly enlarge (over hours) and become acutely painful. A huge number of sickled cells are retained within the spleen during such a crisis, causing a severe anaemia requiring top-up transfusion. In such a case the bilirubin and reticulocyte count will be even higher than normal with an acute drop in Hb.</p>
<h3 id="vaso-occlusive-stroke">Vaso-occlusive stroke</h3>
<p>A rare but serious complication requiring urgent and often repeated exchange transfusion</p>
<h3 id="aplastic-crisis">Aplastic crisis</h3>
<p>A syndrome of severe anaemia characterised by a fall in reticulocyte count and bilirubin compared to their normally elevated levels. This is usually caused by Parvovirus B19 (now renamed erythrovirus) infection. Parvovirus infects red cell precursors in ghe marrow, causing a temprary suspension of red cell production. In healthy patient this causes only a slight dip in red cell numbers and haemoglobin (resulting in a mild febrile illness ‘slapped cheek’ or fifth disease). The increased rate of erythrocyte turnover in sickle cell disease enhances the impact of this loss of red cell production, causing a precipitous drop in Hb. Aplastic crises are seen in other congentic haemolytic anaemias associated with high erythrocyte turnover, such as hereditary spherocytosis.</p>
<h3 id="priapism">Priapism</h3>
<p>A severely painful, prolonged penile erection caused by sickling red cells in the corpora cavernosa of the penis, preventing blood flow out of the penis and eventually tamponade and hypoxia. Acutely this can be helped with perineal ice packs and walking while awaiting urology opinion for nerve blockade of the penis and aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa. In the long term priapism can lead to impotence.</p>
<h3 id="sickle-dactylitis-hand-foot-syndrome">Sickle dactylitis (hand-foot syndrome)</h3>
<p>As the small bones of the hand and feet contain active red marrow during childhood, they are at risk of infarction in children with sickle-cell disease. This manifests acutely with localised pain and swelling and can cause long-term deformity due to infarction.</p>
<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<p>Anaemia is usually well tolerated in sickle cell disease. The oxygen dissociation curve for HbS is shifted to the right compared to HbA, meaning that oxygen is more easily deposited in the tissues. This means that packed red blood cell transfusion for anaemia is rarely required, except for in <a href="#aplastic-crisis">Aplastic crisis</a> or acute splenic sequestration.</p>
<p>Management of acute sickle cell crises is usually conservative and symptomatic with analgesia for pain and wamth, hydration, and IV fluids to reduce the duration of vaso-occlusion. In severe cases exchange transfusion with non-HbS red blood cells is required. The major indications for exchange transfusion are: * Frequent severe sickle pain crises * Central nervous syndrome sickling (<a href="#vaso-occlusive-stroke">Vaso-occlusive stroke</a>) * Priapism * <a href="#acute-chest-syndrome">Acute chest syndrome</a> not responsive to conservative management</p>
<p>Between acute presentations, sickle cell disease patients are prescribed folic acid supplements for chronic haemolytic anaemia. In severe cases, the cytotoxic agent hydroxyurea (AKA hydroxycarbamide) is used to reduce the risk and severity of acute crises. It acts through a variety of mechanisms, including the induction of foetal haemoglobin as discussed above. It stimulates release of nitric oxide, improving pulmonary blood flow and reducing the risk of pulmonary hypertension. It reduces neutrophil and platelet counts, leading to decreased inflammatory stimulation of vaso-occlusion and thrombosis. Hydroxyurea has been shown to be efficatious and safe inpatients with a history of acute chest syndrome or symptomatic anaemia. Side effects include reversible bone marrow suppression, a small increased risk of cancer, and infertility.</p>
