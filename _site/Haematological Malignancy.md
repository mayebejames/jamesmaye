Haematological malignancies are cancers arising from the bone marrow precursor cells. One way of thinking about them is to divide them into four broad categories:
* Leukaemias
* Lymphomas
* Myelodysplasias
* Myeloproliferative disorders

Acute leukaemias are characterised by excess primitive blast cells within the bone marrow, spilling out into the blood. Chronic leukaemias, in contrast, have an excess of more mature blood cells in the marrow and blood. In lymphomas, malignant cells generally are found within the lymph nodes, spleen and thymus rather than the bone marrow. This is a relatively arbitrary distinction however and there is significant overlap between lymphomas and leukaemias. For this reason, some argue to do away with the distinction and instead think about haematological malignancies as either of lymphoid origin or myeloid origin. 

## Leukaemias
* Acute leukaemias
	* [[Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia]] (ALL)
	* [[Acute Myeloid Leukaemia]] (AML)
* Chronic leukaemias
	* Chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia (CLL)
	* [[Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia]] (CML)

### Acute Leukaemias
Acute leukaemias are characterised by an excess (>5%) of primitive blast cells within the marrow. 

[[Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia]] (ALL), is a high-grade haematological malignancy.  It is the commonest form of cancer in children. Central nervous system involvement is common, requiring prophylactic intrathecal cytotoxic therapy. It is generally curable, with a cure rate of  greater than 80% with chemotherapy. ALL is further subclassified based upon immunohistochemistry.

[[Acute Myeloid Leukaemia]], in contrast, predominantly affects adults. It usually requries myelosuppressive chemotherapy in order to reduce remission, although the cure rate is lower than ALL at only ~30%. CNS involvement is rare. It is generally characterised on morphological characteristics (the M0-M7 system).
