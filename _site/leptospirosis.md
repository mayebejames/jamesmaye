description: Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caught from contaminated freshwater. It can develop into Weil's disease and cause multi-organ failure. It is treated best with penicillins.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by *Leptospira spp.* (especially *Leptospira interrogans*) which are <span class='JM-link'>[spirochaetes](spirochaetes)</span>.  It is a <span class='JM-link'>[Zoonotic Disease](zoonotic-disease)</span>, with the spirochaetes excreted in the urine of infected animals entering water sources and infecting humans. Leptospires can survive for days in warm, damp freshwater conditions, making freshwater exposure in areas with considerable animal populations a significant risk factor.  Clinical manifestations of leptospirosis range from asymptomatic infection to [Weil's disease], a potentially life-threatening illness consisting of meningo-encephalitis, pulmonary haemorrhage, and hepatorenal failure. Common presenting symptoms of Leptospirosis infection are non-specific: sudden-onset fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea and vomiting with occasional conjunctival suffusion or haemorrhage (red, swollen conjunctiva similar to conjunctivitis).


## Key Facts
* Clinical Features - biphasic  disease
	* 7-day initial episode with presenting symptoms
		* Febrile, headaches, myalgia, arthralgia
		* Nausea and vomiting
		* Conjunctival suffusion/haemorrhage (red conjunctiva) - towards end of 1st phase
	* Several day remission
	* Immunopathological phase
		* Multisystem organ failure
			* Liver
			* Kidneys
			* Lung
* Risk factors: environmental exposure
	* Freshwater e.g. kayaking/river swimming, working in water/wet conditions e.g. tree surgeon
* Investigations
	* Leptospirosis serology - IgM
		* Good rapid screening test
		* ELISA to *L. biflexa*  Ag
		* Risk of false positives with previous infection or EBV, CMV or viral hepatitis
	* Microscopic agglutination test (MAT)
		* reference test for diagnosis
		* requires panel of live agents and v laborious, seemingly rarely done in UK
	* Urine PCR
		* Detects DNA so can detect pre-Ab production (c.f. serology) and useful even after Abx treatment started
	* LFTs & U&Es
		* To measure hepatorenal failure
		* Need to ensure liver function not worsening prior to discharge
* Management - abx
	* Penicillins: benzylpenicillin IV; Ceftriaxone; doxycycline PO 100mg BD


## Epidemiology and transmission
While endemic to the Tropics, Leptospirosis is a global disease. Epidemics occur following hurricanes or flooding as exposure risk to contaminated freshwater increases. Leptospira can be excreted from the urine of both wild and domestic animals (e.g. rodents, livestock, and dogs) for long periods.  Leptospira then enter the body through cuts and abrasions to the skin or through the mucous membranes either through contaminated water or direct animal contact. 

High risk groups include those undertaking outdoor recreational activities such as kayaking and wild swimming. The UK Reference laboratory reported a significant increase in Leptospirosis cases in 2020, likely due to the increase in domestic 'wild swimming' and other recreational activities due to reduced international travelling. Occupational hazards include veterinarians and those working in possibly contaminated water, such as tree surgeons or rice farmers. 


## Clinical Features
Leptospirosis is classically considered a biphasic disease, with initial symptoms lasting approximately a week followed by several days respite then worsening organ failure ([Weil's disease]).  Presenting features include fevers, headaches, myalgia and arthralgia, GI upset, conjunctival redness, meningo-encephalitis, pulmonary haemorrhage and hepato-renal failure. 

### Symptoms and signs
* Sudden onset fever
* Headaches
* Severe myalgia and arthralgia
* Nausea and vomiting
* Conjunctival suffusion or haemorrhage
	* Conjunctival redness resembling conjunctivitis but without inflammatory exudates.
	* Chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva) is also seen

### In Weil's disease
* Liver failure
	* Jaundice
	* Deranged LFTs & synthetic function
* Pulmonary haemorrhage
	* SOB
	*  Haemoptysis
* Renal failure (hepatorenal failure)
* Meningo-encephalitis
* Septic Shock


### Weil's Disease

## Pathophysiology
<span class='JM-link'>[Spirochaetes](spirochaetes)</span> spread to multiple organs via the blood as leptospira levels increase following exposure. The clinical manifestations of leptospirosis infection reflect the organ dysfunction caused by either direct action of the leptospires or the host immune response to the infection.  This pathological immune response is responsible for the second phase of leptospirosis pathology. While subclinical disease is seen in endemic areas, the majority of cases in the UK will be diagnosed following moderate to severe disease which may be either self-limiting or progress to organ failure ([Weil's disease])
