Gilbert syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic syndrome of mild[^1] unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, presenting as jaundice in the absence of liver injury, haemolysis or any other cause for an elevation of unconjugated bilirubin. Episodes of jaundice are thought to occur when the body is put under stress, such as infection, surgery, fasting, vigorous exercise, or dehydration. Diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome is made by a long-term mildly elevated unconjugated serum bilirubin in the absence of haemolysis, liver disease, or any other disease process that could contrubute to the hyperbilirubinaemia.

## Aetiology and Pathophysiology
Gilbert syndrome is caused by decreased levels of the UDPGT enzyme, responsible for catalyzing the rate-limiting step in bilirubin conjugation.  Mutations in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene, which encodes the UDPGT protein, have been identified in patients with Gilbert syndrome, causing a reduction in production of UPDGT.

Unconjugated bilirubin is a toxic non water-soluble waste product of haemoglobin breakdown. In the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, UDPGT catalyzes the rate-limiting step in conjugation, producing the water-soluble conjugated bilirubin. This is normally excreted as bile, aiding in emulsifying and breaking down foodstuffs in the small intestine. 

In Gilbert syndrome, reduction in levels of UDPGT make the bilirubin conjugation system liable to being overwhelmed. Unconjugated bilirubin levels are therefore much more variable and are generally elevated compared to the general population. Events which may increase unconjugated bilirubin levels, such as illness, dehydration, fasting, or severe exercise, can further overwhelm the bilirubin conjugation system, leading to levels high enough to cause jaundice and scleral icterus. 

## Diagnosis
Due to the often incidental nature of the condition, definitive testing for Gilbert syndrome need not always be carried out. A presumed diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome can be made in a patient with a repeated otherwise asymptomatic unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with no evidence of haemolysis, otherwise normal LFTs, and the exclusion of any other disease process which could explain the rise in bilirubin. If a definitive diagnosis is required, a fasting bilirubin test, liver biopsy, or UGT1A1 genetic testing may be considered. 

### Clinical features
Key diagnostic factors on history and examination include:

* Jaundice, sometimes following identifiable stressors
	* Yellow-tinged skin
	* Yellow-tinger sclera (scleral icterus)
	* Dark (bilirubin-containing) urine is seen in a (water-soluble) conjugated jaundice, not a (non water-soluble) unconjugated jaundice such as in Gilbert syndrome
* Otherwise asymptomatic:
	* Absence of signs of haemolysis
	* Absence of liver dysfunction
	* Absence of hepatosplenomegaly
* Family history for Gilbert Syndrome
* Post-pubertal age, due to puberty-dependent androgen effects leading to increased bilirubin levels

### Investigations
The first (basic) investigations to consider aim to identify a raised unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and the absence of deranged LFTs (excluding bilirubin) and haemolysis. 

* Unconjugated bilirubin levels should be elevated
	* these are elevated in Gilbert syndrome, usually < 51 μmol/L and by definition <102 μmol/L
	* Repeated measurements in six to eighteen months should also be raised
* LFTs including γ-GT should be normal
* Lactate dehydrogenase should be normal 
* FBC & blood smear should show no signs of haemolysis
* Direct Coombs' test should be negative
	* This test excludes ABO or Rh autoimmune haemolytic anaemia


If the diagnosis is uncertain, more involved testing may be considered. Important examples include an assessment of the unconjugated bilirubin level response to fasting for 48 hours, with a 2 to 3-fold rise in response to fasting which returns to normal following several days normal diet considered diagnostic. In lieu fasting, a nicotinic acid challenge test may be alternately employed. Finally, UGT1A1 genotyping or UDPGT enzyme activity may be used, although they do not form the routine work-up for Gilbert syndrome

## Management
No medical management is recommended for Gilbert syndrome, as the jaundice is asymptomatic and resolves alongside the underlying cause. Patients should be counselled that they may become jaundiced during periods of intrinsic or extrinsic stress,  and that remedying the underlying cause will improve their jaundice. They should also be councelled for additional concerning symptoms seen alongside jaundice in more serious conditions, to ensure that superadded conditions are not misinterpreted as merely exacerbations of Gilberts syndrome. Such 'red flags' may include prolonged or severe jaundice, fevers, abdominal pain, or stool and urine colour changes. 

Gilbert syndrome has been noted to cause reactions to various medications, both in the short and long term. Patients should be encouraged to inform medical professionals of their condition when they are considering starting new medications.
