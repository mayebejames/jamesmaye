# Simvastatin amlodipine diltiazem interaction

Simvastatin and amlodipine or diltiazem  interact when prescribed concomitantly.  Diltiazem and amlodipine are cytochrome P450 inhibitors, leading to a reduction in simvastatin metabolism and rise in simvastatin levels. This can cause rhabdomyolysis as an adverse drug reaction.. Because of this, the maximum simvastatin dose with concomitant amlodipine or diltiazem is 20mg per the MHRA 2012 advice.
