## Acute Management

* Mild hyperkalaemia
	* <5.9, no major symptoms or ECG changes
	* Oral management
		* Calcium resonium 15g TDS/QDS  (with 10ml BD lactulose) until K+ 5.5 mmol/L
* Moderate hyperkalaemia
	* 6.0 - 6.4 with or without ECG changes
	* Oral or IV management
* Severe hyperkalaemia
	* >6.5  or >5.9 with major symptoms or ECG changes
	* IV management then oral management once stabilised
		* 1) Calcium gluconate 10% 30ml
			* Over 3-10 (30mins if on digoxin) mins into large vein with ECG telemetry by a doctor
			* ECG after 10 mins - repeat bolus if not normalised
		* 2) Actrapid 10u in 100-125mls 20% glucose
			* Over 15-30 mins to temporarily lower levels, repeat if necessary
			* Risk of hypoglycaemia - monitor BMs every 30 mins for 2 hrs then hourly until 6 hours - will require 10% glucose infusion if so 
			* Lasts 60 minutes - check VBG at 1, 2, 4, 6, 24 hrs

If Hyperkalaemia is resistant to treatment discuss urgently with renal team as patient may require renal replacement therapy ([[Dialysis]])


## Symptoms of Hyperkalaemia

Often asymptomatic, but symptoms can include breathlessness, **muscle weakness**, paralysis, **arrhythmias**.

**ECG changes** include peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, widened QRS, flattened P waves. In extreme cases sine wave pattern, bradycardia and **asystole**


## Causes of Hyperkalaemia

* Drugs
	* Sando-K, NSAIDs, spironolactone, ACEI, trimethoprim, heparin, ciclosporin
* Severe tissue damage (rhabdomyolysis?), acidosis, renal impairment, GI bleed, food
* Artefactual
	* lysis of cells in sample, delays in sample processing, extended tourniquet time causing build up of Potassium levels
	* Thrombocythaemia & EDTA contamination
