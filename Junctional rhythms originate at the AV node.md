# Junctional rhythms originate at the AV node

Junctional rhythms occur when the Atrio-ventricular (AV) junction is the focus initiating depolarisation. The rate of a standard junctional rhythm is 40-100bpm (a junctional escape rhythm). The characteristic features of junctional escape rhythms on ECG are:

-   No p waves in junctional beats 
-   Normal QRS complex morphology
-   Regular rhythm
-   Normal baseline

P waves being lost indicates either no atrial contraction or the p wave being lost in the QRS complexes.

[[Atrial fibrillation]] is also characterised by loss of P waves and normal QRS morphology, however in AF the QRS rhythm is irregularly irregular, with an irregular baseline


Terminology of different junctional rhythms:

-   Junctional bradycardia = junctional rhythm <40 bpm
-   Junctional escape rhythm = junctional rhythm 40-60bpm
-   Accelerated junctional rhythm = 60-100 bpm
-   Junctional tachycardia = junctional rhythm >100bpm

* [[Basal cardiac myocyte pacemaking rate decreases inferiorly through the heart]]
	* Under normal conditions, cardiac myocytes with slower pacemaker action are suppressed by the more rapid impluses from above (i.e. sinus rhythm). [[Junctional rhythms]] and [[Ventricular escape rhythms]] arise when the  rate of supraventricular impulses arriving at the AV node or ventricle is less than that of their intrinsic rate, given above.
