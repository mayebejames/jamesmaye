# Antibiotics in breasfeeding
Medications that are known to be safe in breast feeding include penicillins and cephalosporins:

* Penicillins are safe to use during breastfeeding as they are weak acids and pass poorly into breast milk.
* Cephalosporins are safe to use during breastfeeding as only low concentrations are found in breast milk.
