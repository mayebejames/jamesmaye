# Prolactin is a good test to differentiate between seizure and pseudoseizure
In the first 10-20 minutes following a [[seizure]] where consciousness is impaired (i.e. a complex focal seizure or generalised seizure), serum [[prolactin]] is reliably raised >2x above baseline (or >3 SD above normal). This makes prolactin a good test to determine between epileptic activity and a functional neurological disorder presenting as seizures.	

(Abubakr & Wambacq 2016) found serum prolactin to have a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 72.2%, while costing >$200 per test.
