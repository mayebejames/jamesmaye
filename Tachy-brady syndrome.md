# Tachy-brady syndrome

In Tachy-brady syndrome, patients suffer from alternations of [[Tachycardia]] and [[Bradycardia]]. This can prove difficult to treat medically, as treating one of these (e.g. the tachycardias) increases the risk of the other concomitantly. Pacing for the bradycardic episodes in conjunction with rate-slowing medications (?[[Beta blockers]]?) may be required if a patient is symptomatic or unstable.

* [[Sick sinus syndrome]]
	* Sick sinus syndrome is usually caused by sinus node fibrosis, typically in elderly patients.
	Symptoms include syncope and pre-syncope, light-headedness, palpitations and breathlessness. It is managed with permanent pacemakers for patients who had symptomatic bradycardia or sinus pauses. If AF is detected then thromboembolic prophylaxis is given. Some patients develop [[Tachy-brady syndrome]], with alternating tachycardic and bradycardic rhythms.
