# NT-ProBNP

N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT proBNP) should be measured in all patients with suspected heart failure:
 
* Concentrations > 2,000 ng/litre are associated with poor prognosis. These patients should be referred urgently (i.e. within 2 weeks) for specialist assessment by the heart failure team and a transthoracic echocardiography (NG 106, 2018).
* A concentration between 400 â€“ 2,000 ng/litre - heart failure is suspected and these patients should be referred for specialist assessment by the heart failure team and a transthoracic echocardiography within six weeks (NG 106, 2018).
* Concentrations < 400 ng/litre in an untreated patient means heart failure is unlikely. Other causes for breathlessness should be investigated (NG 106, 2018).
* Note: patients with obesity, patients of African or African-Caribbean family origin, or patients treated with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotension II receptor blockers (ARBs) or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can have reduced levels of serum natriuretic peptides ( [NG 106, 2018](event:https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng106/) ).
* Remember that heart failure is not the only cause of raised natriuretic peptides (e.g. aged over 70, sepsis, COPD, diabetes, renal dysfunction).
