# Drug interactions in antibiotics

* Macrolides (e.g. erythromycin) have the greatest number of interactions.
* Concomitant use of a macrolide and a statin can increase the risk of muscle toxicity. This is probably the commonest antibacterial drug interaction you will see. It is usual practice to temporarily withold the statin.
* Calcium and iron preparations reduce the absorption of quinolones and tetracyclines. You can avoid this by separating the administration times by a few hours.
* There is an increased risk of nephrotoxicity with aminoglycosides when given with furosemide or vancomycin.
* There is decreased excretion of methotrexate when combined with penicillins.
* There is an increased risk of haematological toxicity when trimethoprim or co-trimoxazole is co-administered with methotrexate.
* Macrolides and quinolones can affect the QT interval. Prescribe these with caution in patients taking antiarrythmic drugs.
* Prescribe antibacterials cautiously in patients receiving drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. phenytoin or digoxin).
* Prescribe antibacterials cautiously in patients receiving anticonvulsants, as the seizure threshold can be altered.
