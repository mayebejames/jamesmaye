The most obvious causes for left and right axis deviation are left and right ventricular hypertrophy, respectively. There are many other causes to consider however, some of which are described below.


## Right axis deviation
Right axis deviation can be caused by right heart strain. A new right axis deviation is suggestive of acute right ventricular strain due to increased pulmonary pressure e.g. due to a large [[pulmonary embolism]]. The more chronic pulmonary hypertension and right atrio-ventricular hypertrophy (cor pulmonale) due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in COPD causes RAD similarly. 


## Left axis deviation
LAD is most commonly caused by left ventricular hypertrophy or a conduction defect, either of the His bundle itself ([[Left bundle branch block]]) or loss of cardiomyocytes to depolarise in the right atrium and ventricle due to [[Inferior myocardial infarction]].


## Extreme axis deviation
In the absence of other pathology the most common cause is leads mix ups. Pathologic genuine causes include ventricular rhythms ([[Ventricular tachycardia]], [[Accelerated idioventricular rhythm]], [[Ventricular Ectopics]]), hyperkalaemia, and  severe right ventricular hypertrophy.

* [[The cardiac axis]]
	* The cardiac axis is the average direction of ventricular depolarisation when looking at the heart from the front of the chest. It is important clinically because [[Cardiac axis deviation has various pathological causes]]. [[Determining the cardiac axis]] is done by assessing whether the QRS complexes in leads I, II, and III are net positive or negative, as [[The relative sizes of the R and S waves depends upon the direction of depolarisation]].
* [[Determining the cardiac axis]]
	* [[The cardiac axis]] is the mean vector of ventricular depolarisation within the QRS wave, looking at the heart face on from the front of the chest. Leads, I, II and to a lesser extent III are used to determine the cardiac axis. Determining this can be clinically useful as [[Cardiac axis deviation has various pathological causes]]
	* Extreme axis deviation, when leads I, II, and aVF are negative while aVR Â± III and aVL are positive, is a rare finding which in an otherwise clinically well patient is most likely explained by reversal of the right arm and left leg ECG leads.
