# Fluid Loss

## Sources of fluid loss:
Urine:
* A healthy person will pass approximately 1 ml/kg/hour. This roughly equates to 1700 ml per day in a 70 kg adult (a reasonable daily urine volume is 1.5 to 2.5 litres per day).  
* In fluid replacement, you should aim for a minimum urine output of 0.5 ml/kg/hour.

Gastrointestinal:
* Gastrointestinal losses are normally minor.
* Approximately 100 ml/day lost via the faeces.  
* However these losses can be substantial in someone with diarrhoea, vomiting, biliary drains and high stoma output.  
	* Vomiting may cause loss of potassium, chloride and hydrogen ions (and thus leads to a picture of hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis, sometimes accompanied by mild hypokalaemia).

* Quantify and document such losses.  

Insensible losses:
* Insensible losses are those via the skin, breathing and other immeasurable routes.  
* In an average person, this approximates 500â€“800 ml per day.  
* Insensible losses can increase. For example, losses can increase significantly if a patient is sweating, febrile, tachypnoeic, or undergoing open cavity surgery.
* It is useful to estimate and document such losses.  


Other:
* Surgical
	*  (especially biliary drains- bile is a rich source of electrolyte and fluid loss), pleural and peritoneal drain output.
	* fistulae
	* stoma
* Bleeding.
* Burns - leading to excessive fluid loss through the skin.
