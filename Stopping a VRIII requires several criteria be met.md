Stopping a sliding scale of insulin (variable rate intravenous insulin infusion, VRIII)  requires that a patient has eaten 100% of two consecutive meals. Following this, normal non-basal insulin regimes can be restarted prior to the next breakfast or dinner and VRIII stopped 1 hour after this. VRIII should only be stopped within normal working hours (9-5)  and should be done using trust guidelines and/or help from the diabetes specialist nursing team.
