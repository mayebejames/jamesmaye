# Antibiotics in pregnancy
Cephalosporins are safe to use in pregnancy


## Drugs to avoid

### First Trimester

* Co-trimoxazole – risk of teratogenicity.
* Trimethoprim – risk of teratogenicity -  although short courses (e.g. 3-7 days) are no longer believed to be problematic, and are unlikely to be harmful in non-folate deficient women.  A thorough history will be required before initiating a course, and consultation with an obstetrician is  advised.
* Rifampicin – high doses teratogenic in animal models.


### Second and Third Trimesters

* Chloramphenicol (except topically) – risk of grey baby syndrome.
* Co-trimoxazole – risk of neonatal haemolysis and methaemoblobinaemia.
* Nitrofurantoin – risk of haemolysis at term.
* Rifampicin – risk of increased neonatal bleeding.


### Throughout pregnancy

* Tetracyclines – affect skeletal development, discolouration of teeth.
* Quinolones  (e.g. cipro-, levofloxacin) – risk of arthropathy in animal models.
* Imipenem (toxicity in animal studies)
*
