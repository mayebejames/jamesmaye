# Determining RCA vs LCx occlusion in inferior STEMI

An [[Inferior myocardial infarction]] most commonly occurs due to the occlusion of a dominant [[Right coronary artery]] (80%). In a significant minority (18%) of cases, the occlusion is in a dominant [[Left circumflex artery]].

The right coronary artery supplies the more lateral (right) aspects of the inferior wall of the heart, while a dominant left circumflex will supply the more medial (left) aspects of the inferior wall. This means that in an RCA occlusion the ECG abnormalities project more towards the right, with greater ST elevation in the more rightward-facing lead III than lead II and reciprocal ST depression in lead I. Additional ST elevation in V1 is suggestive of right ventricular infarction due to RCA occlusion. 

In left circumflex occlusion, the more leftward-pointing direction of abnormality means an absence of reciprocal ST depression in lead I and equal ST elevation in leads II and III. Further ST elevation in the lateral leads I and aVL or V5-6 are suggestive of lateral infarction. In patients with an inferior STEMI, ST elevation of 2mm+ in V5-6  is therefore predictive of extensive coronary artery disease and a large area of infarction.

## ECG Findings Summary
RCA occlusion inferior infarct (80%)
* ST elevation III > II
* Reciprocal ST depression I
* + ST elevation V1→ Right ventricular infarction due to RCA occlusion

Lcx occlusion (18%)
* ST elevation II = III
* No reciprocal ST depression I
* ST elevation lateral leads: I, aVL, V5-6
	* → inferior + lateral infarction i.e. extensive coronary disease
