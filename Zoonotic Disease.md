* [[Leptospirosis]]
	* Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by *Leptospira spp.* (especially *Leptospira interrogans*) which are [[spirochaetes]].  It is a [[Zoonotic Disease]], with the spirochaetes excreted in the urine of infected animals entering water sources and infecting humans. Leptospires can survive for days in warm, damp freshwater conditions, making freshwater exposure in areas with considerable animal populations a significant risk factor.  Clinical manifestations of leptospirosis range from asymptomatic infection to [[/Weil's disease]], a potentially life-threatening illness consisting of meningo-encephalitis, pulmonary haemorrhage, and hepatorenal failure. Common presenting symptoms of Leptospirosis infection are non-specific: sudden-onset fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea and vomiting with occasional conjunctival suffusion or haemorrhage (red, swollen conjunctiva similar to conjunctivitis).
