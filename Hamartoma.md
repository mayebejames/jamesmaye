*Not to be confused with a [[Haematoma]]*

A Hamartoma is a benign congenital tumour composed of tissues normally found in its locality.  They can be found anywhere in the body, most commonly in the lung (a common cause of benign [[Pulmonary Nodule]]), hypothalamus, breast and colon.  They are caused by abnormal formation of normal tissue during development leading a disorganised growth of tissue at the same rate of normal tissue. While usually sporadic they can occur as part of particular syndromes.

While the majority of hamartomas are asymptomatic and picked up incidentally on imaging ([[Incidentalomas]]), hamartomas can cause pathology by malignant transformation, infection, infarction, external pressure/obstruction, or haemorrhage and subsequent anaemia.
