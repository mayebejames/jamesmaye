# Neutropenic sepsis


From SCRIPT Sepsis teaching:
> Patients with sepsis may be neutropenic for two reasons:
>  
> An underlying condition or recent treatment with an immunosuppressant or systemic anticancer therapy.
>  
> The sepsis itself has caused neutropenia due to destruction of neutrophils by the infecting microorganism.
>  
> Finding a source of infection can be difficult due to a lack of localising signs. Neutrophils are required to make pus, and so **there may be no signs on a chest X-ray or erythema around a wound.**
>  
> All patients with neutropenia, regardless of the aetiology, must be cared for in either a positive pressure or neutral pressure ventilated side-room with an en suite. They must be reverse barrier nursed.
>  
> In patients with neutropenia due to sepsis, treatment of the infection should result in resolution of the sepsis.
