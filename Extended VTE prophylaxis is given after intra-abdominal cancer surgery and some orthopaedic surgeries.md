# Extended VTE prophylaxis is given after intra-abdominal cancer surgery and some orthopaedic surgeries
The specifics of extended VTE prophylaxis vary by condition and trust policy, but two common rules of thumb are either a further 28 days after the operation or 28 days following discharge. Details can be found in the excellent and exhaustive  [NICE Guidance on Venous Thromboembolism in over 16s](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng89)[1]. The guidelines for abdominal surgery (applicable to WSH General Surgery placement) can be found below:



### Abdominal surgery
1.14.1
Offer VTE prophylaxis to people undergoing abdominal (gastrointestinal, gynaecological, urological) surgery who are at increased risk of VTE. For people undergoing bariatric surgery, follow the  [recommendations in the section on bariatric surgery](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng89/chapter/recommendations#bariatric-surgery) .

1.14.2
Start mechanical VTE prophylaxis on admission for people undergoing abdominal surgery. Choose either:
	* anti-embolism stockings or
	* intermittent pneumatic compression.

Continue until the person no longer has significantly reduced mobility relative to their normal or anticipated mobility. **[2018]**

1.14.3
Add pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for a minimum of 7 days for people undergoing abdominal surgery whose risk of VTE outweighs their risk of bleeding, taking into account individual patient factors and according to clinical judgement. Choose either:
	* LMWH or
	* fondaparinux sodium. 

In March 2018, the use of LMWH and fondaparinux sodium in young people under 18 was off label. See  [NICE's information on prescribing medicines](https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/nice-guidance/nice-guidelines/making-decisions-using-nice-guidelines#prescribing-medicines) .

1.14.4
Consider extending pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to 28 days postoperatively for people who have had major cancer surgery in the abdomen. **[2018]**
